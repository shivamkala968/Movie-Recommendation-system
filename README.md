# Movie-Recommendation-system
MovieLens GroupLens Research has collected and made available rating data sets from the MovieLens web site (http://movielens.org). The data sets were collected over various periods of time, depending on the size of the set.

Small: 100,000 ratings and 3,600 tag applications applied to 9,000 movies by 600 users. Last updated 9/2018.

#NOTE -there are larger data set available online.
The smaller dataset is used in order to complete the process under the constraint of Personal Laoptop or PC. larger datasets-https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/

The performance metrics will significantly improve on using larger dataset.

#Objectives:

Predict the rating that a user would give to a movie that he ahs not yet rated.
Minimize the difference between predicted and actual rating (RMSE and MAPE)
Constraints:

#Some form of interpretability.
Type of Machine Learning Problem
For a given movie and user we need to predict the rating would be given by him/her to the movie. 
The given problem is a Recommendation problem 
It can also seen as a Regression problem 

#Machine Learning Objective and Constraints
Minimize RMSE.
Try to provide some interpretability.
